                <h4>3.What is semantic tag?</h4>
                <p>Semantic elements are HTML tags that carry meaning about the structure of the page and its content. Examples include header, nav, main, section, article, footer, etc.</p>
                <h4>4.What is a Html Web Worker?</h4>
                <p>A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Inline CSS :</strong> You can apply styles directly to an HTML element using the "style" attribute. </li>
                  <li><strong>Internal CSS :</strong> You can define CSS styles within the "style" element in the head section of the HTML document.</li>
                  <li><strong>External CSS :</strong> You can create a separate CSS file with all the styles and link it to your HTML document using the "link" element.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>3.What are the different CSS selectors?</h4>

                <p>The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how the space around an HTML element is calculated. It consists of four components:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Content :</strong> The actual content area of the element, where text, images, or other media are displayed.</li>
                  <li><strong>Padding :</strong> The space between the content and the element's border.</li>
                  <li><strong>Border :</strong> A border surrounding the padding and content.</li>
                  <li><strong>Margin :</strong> The space between the element's border and other elements on the page.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>5.Describe the difference between "display: block," "display: inline," and "display: inline-block."</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>display: block :</strong> This property take up the full width available and start on a new line. They ignore the width and height properties of their content.</li>
                <li> <strong>display: inline :</strong> This property only take up content width as necessary and do not start on a new line. They respect the width and height properties of their content.Inline elements flow within the content and can appear next to each other on the same line.</li>
                <li> <strong>display: inline-block :</strong> This property are similar to inline elements but can have specified width and height properties. They do not start on a new line.elements that can flow inline but still have a specific size and spacing.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- <h2 style="display:block;width:300px;height:200px; margin:30px; padding:10px;background-color:lightblue">i'm veeramani</h2><h2 style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:200px; margin:30px; padding:10px;background-color:lightblue">i'm veeramani</h2> -->
                <h4>6.What is the importance of the "z-index" property?</h4>
                <p>The "z-index" property is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements on a webpage.It only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, 
                position: relative, position: fixed).</p>
                <h4>7.What is the purpose of media queries in CSS, and how are they used for responsive web design?</h4>
                <p>They are essential for creating responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a better user experience on various devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
                <h4>8.Explain the concept of CSS specificity and how it determines which styles are applied to an element.</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Inline styles (style attribute): Highest specificity</li>
                  <li>ID selectors</li>
                  <li>Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes</li>
                  <li>Type selectors and pseudo-elements: Lowest specificity</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>9.Position property in CSS ? </h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>position: static :</strong> This is the default positioning value for all elements.</li>
                  <li><strong>position: relative :</strong> Positioned relative to its normal position, and other elements are not affected.</li>
                  <li><strong>position: absolute :</strong> Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the document body. It is removed from the normal document flow.</li>
                  <li><strong>position: fixed :</strong> Positioned relative to the viewport. It is removed from the normal document flow and remains fixed even when scrolling.</li>
                  <li><strong>position: relative :</strong> The element is treated as position: relative until it reaches a specified offset position (e.g., top, bottom, left, or right). After that, it behaves like position: fixed; and remains fixed to the specified position.</li>
                </ul>

                  <div class="box">

                <p><strong>Flexbox :</strong> Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model, which means it deals with arranging elements along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). It is best suited for creating layouts in rows or columns. <br>
                  <strong id="js">Grid Layout :</strong> Grid layout is a two-dimensional layout model, allowing you to create complex layouts with both rows and columns. It divides the container into a grid of cells, making it suitable for creating multi-dimensional layouts.</p>
